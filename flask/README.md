# Getting Started

<a name="installing-dependencies"></a>
### Installing Dependencies

<a name="python-3.7"></a>
#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

<a name="virtual-environment"></a>
#### Virtual Environment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

<a name="pip-dependencies"></a>
#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

<a name="database-setup"></a>
## Database Setup

With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:
```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

<a name="running-the-server"></a>
## Running the server

From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
cd flask
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `flaskr` directs flask to use the `flaskr` directory and the `__init__.py` file to find the application. 

<a name="response-codes"></a>
# Response Codes 

#### Response Codes
```
200: Success
400: Bad request
404: Cannot be found
422: Unprocessable Entity 
50X: Server Error
```
#### Example Error Message
```json
{
  "details": "404 Not Found: The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.", 
  "error": 404, 
  "message": "Not found", 
  "success": false
}

The available tests in this project checks that the following are true:
    
1. You are able to get paginated questions using `GET '/questions'`
2. You are able to get questions from specific search term using `POST '/questions/search'`
3. You are able to get questions for quiz from previous_questions array & quiz_category object using `POST '/quizzes'`
4. You are able to create new question and store in the db using  `POST '/questions'`
